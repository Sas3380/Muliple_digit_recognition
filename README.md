# Multiple Digit Recognition with Neural Networks

Welcome to the **Multiple Digit Recognition** project! This repository demonstrates how to use a neural network to classify images containing multiple digits (0-9). The neural network is trained on a dataset of 28x28 grayscale images, capable of recognizing and classifying digits from 0 to 9 in a multi-digit image.

## How to Run the Project

1. **Clone this repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Sas3380/Multiple_digit_recognition.git
